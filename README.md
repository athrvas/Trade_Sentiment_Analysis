## ‚úÖ Key Analyses Performed

### 1. Sentiment Shift Analysis
- Analyzes how changes in market sentiment (e.g., Fear ‚ûù Neutral) affect P&L distribution and trading behavior.
- **Insight**: Traders perform better during improving sentiment regimes, especially when transitioning out of fear.

### 2. Volatility Analysis
- Assesses how volatility and risk-adjusted returns vary with sentiment phases.
- Includes time-series overlays of volatility with sentiment categories.
- **Insight**: Neutral sentiment periods often balance volatility and profitability effectively.

### 3. Performance Consistency Analysis
- Evaluates trader consistency using Win Rate, Mean vs Median P&L, and a custom Consistency Score.
- **Insight**: Positive sentiment leads to higher consistency and lower variance in performance.

### 4. Sentiment Duration Analysis
- Studies how the **length of sentiment phases** impacts trader performance.
- **Insight**: Longer stable sentiment periods‚Äîespecially bullish‚Äîenable better returns and fewer losses.

### 5. Long vs Short Strategy Analysis
- Compares how long and short strategies perform under different sentiments.
- **Insight**: Long trades outperform in Greed/Positive conditions; short strategies are effective during Negative phases.

### 6. Risk-Reward Analysis
- Focuses on profit quality: Risk-Reward Ratio, Expectancy, Profit Factor, etc.
- **Insight**: Positive sentiment provides the highest reward per risk unit; consistency is highest in Neutral/Positive phases.

### 7. Asset-Specific Sentiment Analysis
- Measures sentiment-performance correlation for individual coins.
- Identifies best and worst sentiment conditions per asset.
- **Insight**: Some assets thrive under specific sentiment regimes, enabling strategy customization.
